          <p>A basic weekend in San Francisco usually starts off with a basic bottomless mimosas brunch. San Franciscans will wake up early in the morning and will willingly wait in line for over an hour just to be able to nurse their hangovers with unlimmitted mimosas and eggs bennies. Protip: If brunch food is regular in your weekly retuine, do yourself a favor and buy brunch Groupons for you and your best brunch friends.

                <p>Dolores Park is the place to be on any given Saturday or Sunday. It is <b>always</b> sunny in Dolores Park. It can be raining and storming in the rest of the city but Dolores park will be sunny af. Until, of course about 4pm when Karl the Fog rolls through and then you gotta put on your warmerst windbreaker or a parka to stay warm. Dolores park is a very special place, there's nothing really that is more San Francisco than it. It has the raddest view, the best pina colodas, and even a guy that walks around selling <i>truffles</i>. They are delish, but fairwarning don't like try to be productive or anything after eating one or ten. (full descretion 1 is enough). At Dolores you will see rare locals hanging out with techie transplants. You will see hoolahoops and people doing cool tricks. If you are from here and know like at least 10 people, you are bound to run into at least half of them.

                 <p>If you live in San Francisco and you don't go to live shows at least a couple times a month, you need to go live somewhere else so more rental space opens up for people who appreciate the best thing the city has to offer: live music. No matter what your taste, San Francisco has it. Festival season is especially fun because all the touring bands always come through SF where you can enjoy seeing them live in much smaller intimate venues. A few notable ones are the Mezzanine, Public Works, Audio SF and 1015 Folsom but you really want to avoid 1015 Folsom if you can because nothing good ever happens after a night there
